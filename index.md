# Digital materials processing and discovery

We develop AI-driven atomistic simulation frameworks for predictive materials design. By integrating deep reinforcement learning, machine-learning interatomic potentials, and automated workflows, we bridge experimental complexity with atomistic modeling to understand and predict materials formation, evolution, and functionality. Our research addresses fundamental questions in chemical bonding, materials processing, and ion transport.

We use computational tools to understand and design materials, including electronic materials for heterojunctions, ionic conductors for energy storage, and heterogeneous (electro)catalysts.
